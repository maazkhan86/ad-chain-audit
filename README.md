# 🛡️ AdChainAudit

**Audit the programmatic ad supply chain, starting with `ads.txt`** 🔍  
A serious, hacker-style toolkit for **Supply Path Optimization (SPO)** and supply-chain transparency.

✅ Built for **marketers, agencies, adops, publisher ops, and procurement**  
👩‍💻 Open source for **technical contributors** (GitHub)

**Live app:** https://adchainaudit.streamlit.app/  
**Repo:** https://github.com/maazkhan86/AdChainAudit

## 🚨 Why this matters (industry reality)

Programmatic supply chains are complex, costly, and still hard to verify end-to-end.

- **ads.txt exists to reduce counterfeit inventory and increase transparency.** It is a public record of authorized sellers.

- **Supply-chain leakage is measurable.** ISBA/PwC found ~51% of spend reached publishers (“working media”), with ~15% as an “unknown delta” in the studied supply chain.

- **Fraud waste is massive.** Juniper Research (via PRNewswire) estimated 22% ($84B) of online ad spend was wasted due to ad fraud in 2023, projected to exceed $170B in 5 years.

- **Even “efficiency improvements” still leave a lot on the table.** ANA’s 2024 Programmatic Benchmark reporting highlights that for every $1,000 entering a DSP, 43.9% reaches consumers (as reported publicly).

**Bottom line:** SPO is not just about cheaper CPMs. It is about **provable paths**. ✅

## What it does today

### Phase 1: ads.txt audit ✅
You can fetch, upload, or paste an ads.txt input and get:

- 📊 A simple **risk score**
- 🧾 A **buyer-friendly summary** of potential red flags
- 🧷 **Line-level evidence** (what, where, why it matters)
- ⬇️ Exportable reports (**JSON / TXT / CSV**)

**Initial red-flag rules**
- ❌ Malformed lines (wrong number of fields)
- ❌ Invalid relationship values (must be `DIRECT` or `RESELLER`)
- ⚠️ Missing Certification Authority ID (optional signal)
- ⚠️ Relationship ambiguity (same seller listed as `DIRECT` and `RESELLER`)

> Philosophy: evidence-first, buyer-relevant, not “cosmetic lint”.

### Phase 2: sellers.json verification (live)
When enabled, AdChainAudit can **verify ad systems from ads.txt** against **sellers.json** signals, to help answer questions like:
- “Is this seller ID declared in sellers.json?”
- “Does sellers.json classify them as PUBLISHER or INTERMEDIARY?”
- “Are there obvious mismatches that deserve follow-up?”

⚠️ Note: Some endpoints may block automated fetches. If a fetch fails, the app should guide you to upload inputs manually where possible.

## 🧾 How to get an ads.txt (for any site)

1) Open: `https://example.com/ads.txt`  
2) If it 404s, try: `https://www.example.com/ads.txt`  
3) Copy all text and paste it into AdChainAudit, or save it as `ads.txt` and upload.

### Demo input (built-in)
The app includes a sample snapshot so you can test instantly:  
`thestar.com.my/ads.txt` (captured 14 Dec 2025)

ads.txt changes over time. Treat this as demo input only.

## 🧠 Roadmap (where this is going)

### Phase 1 — Ads.txt hardening ✅
✅ Ads.txt parsing + validation
✅ Risk scoring + red-flag report
✅ Domain mode: example.com → fetch https://example.com/ads.txt
⬜ Change detection: diff + alerts (new sellers, new resellers, new risk)

### Phase 2 — Seller verification (sellers.json) ✅
✅ Fetch/validate sellers.json per ad system (when accessible)
✅ Verify seller IDs + seller type signals (where available)
✅ Evidence locker (store artifacts + timestamps + buyer pack ZIP)

### Phase 3 — Full supply-chain graph (schain) 🟡 in progress
✅ Parse/decode schain into hop objects (OpenRTB SupplyChain)
⬜ Visual hop graph in-app (clean, app-like view)
⬜ SPO scoring: hops, reseller concentration, unknown hops, path cleanliness
⬜ Buyer controls: allowlists / blocklists / preferred paths

### Phase 4 — Operator mode ⬜
⬜ CLI: adchainaudit scan <domain|file>
⬜ Portfolio scanning (multiple domains)
⬜ Scheduled scans + dashboards + PDF buyer packs
⬜ GitHub Actions / CI checks for publisher ops workflows
