# Contributing to AdChainAudit 🛡️

Thanks for considering contributing — AdChainAudit is open to collaborators. 🚀  
If you care about **Supply Path Optimization (SPO)**, transparency, and buyer-relevant auditing, you’re in the right place.

This project aims to be:
- 🔎 **Evidence-first** (every finding should point to the exact line / artifact)
- 🎯 **Buyer-relevant** (signal what changes decision quality, not cosmetic noise)
- 🧱 **Composable** (small rule modules that scale from ads.txt → sellers.json → schain)

## 🏁 Getting started

1. 🍴 **Fork the repo**
2. 🌿 **Create a feature branch** (`feature/your-thing`)
3. 🧫 **Add tests + sample fixtures** (if possible)
4. 📬 **Open a PR** with a clear description + screenshots (if UI)

## ✅ Rule PR checklist (simple)

When proposing a new check, please include:

- ⚠️ **What is the risk?**
- 🎯 **Why does a buyer care?**
- 🧠 **How does the tool detect it?**
- 🧾 **Example input → expected output**
- 🧪 **Tests included/updated** (strongly preferred)

## 🧭 Severity guide (recommended)

- 🟥 CRITICAL: malformed lines / invalid values / missing required fields

- 🟧 HIGH: relationship ambiguity, suspicious seller declarations, high buyer risk

- 🟨 MEDIUM: transparency gaps (e.g., missing optional IDs), cautionary signals

- 🟩 LOW: informational signals that don’t materially change buying decisions
